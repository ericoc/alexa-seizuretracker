## stuff I should do to improve this (aka. TODO)

#### primary goals

* DONE! ~~actually hook in to the [seizuretracker.com](https://seizuretracker.com/) API!~~
* DONE! ~~Account Linkage to SeizureTracker.com~~ see [login.php](login.php)
* DONE! ~~add seizures~~ see `add_seizure` function within [seizure.events.php](seizure.events.php)
* DONE! ~~need to be able to update end date of most recent seizure within `EndSeizure` intent (`end_seizure` function)~~
* [DONE!](https://www.amazon.com/Seizure-Tracker/dp/B074HBVHRJ/) ~~actually get it submitted to Amazon for certification and hopefully get published as an Alexa Skill for any one to use maybe?!~~

ALL DONE :D

---


#### others

* IN PROGRESS: track VNS swipes/usage
* track whether medication was taken
* `class{}`-y PHP would be great...
* perhaps do some other stuff with Flash Briefing which announces count of seizures for the prior day...?
* somehow make `handle_seizure()` cooler instead of just treating whatever string it returns as success
* maybe do more intense checking on phrases received from Alexa?
  - it absolutely cannot do proper voice-to-text on the word *"ended"* no matter how I pronounce it!
      * I've gotten back *"and 8"*, *"I ate and"*, and all kinds of crazy stuff that's not even close
  - just waiting may fix this since hopefully Alexa speech-to-text will improve with time
